#guessing game.
#The game gets a random number between 1 and 1000.
#The player gets 10 guesses.
#With each guess the game tells them if
#they are too high or too low or correct.
#They start off with 10 points.
#Each wrong guess subtracts one point.
#When they are done it displays their score and
#asks if they want to play again.
#If they say yes it restarts the game. I
#f not it shows their previous scores and the
#average of those scores and says goodbye.Â 
#You should break the game into functions.
#It involves for loops, while loops and ifs.
